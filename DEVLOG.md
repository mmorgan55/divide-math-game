# Introduction
* This file is mainly to log my process as I am developing this. I think that this will help me see certain issues in my development process and hopefully help me become a better developer by looking back and see where I could have done better.

## Days 1 & 2
* For the most part, day one was me trying to create a basic layout and learn more about how Draggable and DragTarget classes worked. It was certainly a process and more difficult to find what was going wrong, especially when trying to lean how to transfer data from the Draggable to the DragTarget. By day two, I was able to successfully get data from the Draggables into the DragTargets. However, I think that I need to focus more on the logic of the game itself before I worry about creating the UI.
